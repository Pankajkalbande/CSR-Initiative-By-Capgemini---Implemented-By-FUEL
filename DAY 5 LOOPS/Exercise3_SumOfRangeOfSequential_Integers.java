/*Exercise 3 â€” Sum of a Range of Sequential Integers
Write a program that asks the user for two integers, low and high and then sums all the integers 
(inclusive) low through N. 
Enter low:
5
Enter high:
10
Sum = 45
Do this by noticing that the sum from low to high is the same as the sum from one to high minus 
the sum from one to (low-1). Calculate each of these by using the formula: 
sum = (n*(n+1))/2 */
