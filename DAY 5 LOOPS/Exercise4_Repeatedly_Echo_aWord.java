/* Exercise 4 â€” Repeatedly Echo a Word
Write a program that asks the user to enter a word. The program will then repeat word for as 
many times as it has characters: 
Enter a word:
Hello
3
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
To do this you will need to use the length() method of String that counts the number of 
characters in a string: 
String inputString;
int times;
. . . .
times = inputString.length()*/
